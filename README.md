# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised Machine Learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of diabetes in a patient using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**. It includes full data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and real-time prediction based on user input.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess medical data
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Train multiple ML models and compare their performance
- Visualize model metrics and feature importance
- Make predictions based on real-time user input
